  <b>✨ QuotLyBot: Quick & Easy Quotes! ✨</b>

  Turn messages into stylish quotes in Telegram. Here's how:

  📱 <b>Basic Quoting</b>

  • Reply & Quote:  Reply to a message and type <code>/q</code> to quote it.
  • Quote Multiple: Reply to the first of several messages, type <code>/q [number]</code> (e.g., <code>/q 3</code>) to quote multiple.
  • Forward & Quote: Forward a message to the bot to quote it directly.

  🎨 <b>Customize Your Quote</b>

  • Colors:
      • Basic: <code>/q red</code> (or blue, green, etc.)
      • Custom: <code>/q #[hex color code]</code> (e.g., <code>/q #cbafff</code>)
      • Random: <code>/q random</code>
  • Media:  Include images/videos from the quoted message with <code>/q m</code> or <code>/q media</code>
      • Crop Media: Use <code>/q c</code> or <code>/q crop</code> to crop the media.
  • Keep Replies: Show the message being replied to with <code>/q r</code> or <code>/q reply</code>
  • Image Format: Use <code>/q i</code> or <code>/q img</code> or <code>/q p</code> or <code>/q png</code> for image quotes (instead of stickers).

  💡 <b>Cool Combinations</b>

  • White quote with replies: <code>/q 3 white rp</code>
